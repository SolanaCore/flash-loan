## Instruction Introspection

**Instruction introspection** is a powerful feature on Solana that allows a program to **analyze other instructions within the same transaction**, even if they havenâ€™t yet executed. This enables the program to:

* Dynamically respond to or modify behavior
* Inject validation checks or safeguards
* Coordinate logic across multiple instructions, including those from **external programs**

This capability is made possible by a **special sysvar account**:

```
SysvarInstructions1111111111111111111111111
```

Sysvars are **read-only accounts** maintained by the Solana runtime that expose internal state to programs (e.g., `clock`, `rent`, `epoch_schedule`, etc.).
The **Instructions sysvar** specifically exposes:

* The full list of instructions in the current transaction
* Metadata for each instruction
* Serialized instruction data

## Use Case

Instruction introspection is particularly useful when you need to **verify or inspect instructions** passed in a single transaction.
This is common in advanced use cases like:

* Flash loans
* Atomic swaps
* Access control across composable programs

In this flash loan project, we use introspection to validate that the borrower **calls the correct repayment instruction within the same transaction**.

The process looks like this:

1. **Read the Instructions sysvar**
2. **Parse the instructions in the transaction**
3. **Locate the instruction that repays the loan**
4. **Verify the amount, recipient, and token match expectations**

By doing this, we ensure the flash loan is **repaid in the same atomic transaction**, reducing risk and removing the need for trust.
